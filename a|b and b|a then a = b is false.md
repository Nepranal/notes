# Proposition

> Is the following statement true or false? For all integers a and b, if a|b and b|a then a = b

# Proof

$a|b \implies b = ka, b|a \implies a = lb$.

$$
a = lka\\
lk = 1
$$

which implies $l,k$ must both either be 1 or -1. Obviously, if they're both 1, the equation is satisfied. This however won't work with -1. The counter example would be a = -b to disprove the proposition.
