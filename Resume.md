# Projects

**Image Scaling Service** | _Amazon AWS, S3 bucket, AWS SQS 2025_

- Deployed an amazon aws node that can accept requests of resizing an image

**24 Card Game** | _Java RMI, Java Swing, MySQL, JDBC, glassfish 2025_

- Developed a game server and client for playing the 24 card game. The game server contains a play room for 2-4 players and a timeout mechanism.
- Used the MySQL database using JDBC to store game information and to display game-related information

**Learned Step-Size Quantization** | _Python, Pytorch 2024_

- Implemented an unofficial implementation of the Learned Step Size Quantization method
  - Steven K. Esser, Jeffrey L. McKinstry, Deepika Bablani, Rathinakumar Appuswamy, & Dharmendra S. Modha. (2020). Learned Step Size Quantization.

**Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Server** | _Python 2024_

- Developed a game server and client that is thread safe utilizing semaphores. The server would allow multiple games in separate rooms to take place at the same time

**Contemporary Web Applications** | _HTML, CSS, JS, React, Express, MongoDB 2024_

- Developed an item listing application which allows users to update, upload, and delete items from the list using React. The backend was developed using Express and Mongoose

**Music Decoder** | _FPGA 2023_

- Developed a decoder that can decode a sound byte that contains a message. The decoder consists of 3 main components: Signal decoder, Symbol decoder, and a UART component. The message can be viewed with softwares like putty.

**Multithreaded LLM** | _C 2023_

- Modified a Large Language Model (LLM) by Andrej Karpathy. In particular, the matrix multiplication part of the code was changed so it can be done in parallel. This results in quicker story generation by the LLM.

**Automated Library Cataloging Robot** | _Raspberry PI, Arduino, Python, RFID 2023_

- A group project which comprises of 4 members. We developed an Automated Guided Vehicle which can follow a certain path to scan books and other related things that have an RFID tag using an RFID scanner. To reach higher levels, the robot has a lift on which the scanners are attached. The robot also has an authentication system using fingerprint detection. The whole robot can be operated with a touch screen.

**Web Socket Tic-Tac-Toe** | _Java 2023_
