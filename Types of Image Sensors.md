# Converting Light To Electric Charge

The idea is to let photons kick out valence electron from your element. This creates an electron-hole pair which then can be converted into electricty. The usual element you'd use for this is the Silicon atom

# Charged Coupled Device (CCD)

CCD, and some other types of sensing devices, works on the basis of a potential well. These potential wells capture photons for a certain amount of time and can convert them into electrical charges. The wells will also hold them for a certain amount of time.

In the case of CCD, these potential wells will be processed row by rows forming a sort of brigade for electrical charges.

At the end, the charges are converted into voltages

## Complimentary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)

An alternative to CCD is the CMOS. it works under the same principle but now it allows you to access the charges per pixel providing a sort of random access.
