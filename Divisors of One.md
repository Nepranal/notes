# Proposition

> The only divisors of 1 are 1 and -1.

# Proof

Say $a$ divides 1 then $1 = ka$ where $k,a \in \Z - \{0\}$. Since 1 is positive, $a,k$ must both have the same sign.

Let's consider for when $a,k$ are both positive. By properties of divisibility, $1 \ge a > 0$ which implies $a$ must be 1.

When both are negative, we can rewrite them as $a = -a', k = -k'$ where $a', k'$ are positive. We'll come back to the case of $1 = (-a')(-k') = a'k'$. By previous reasoning, we know that $a' = 1$ and that $a = -a' = -1$.

Since these are the only possible cases, the divisors of 1 must only be -1 and 1.
