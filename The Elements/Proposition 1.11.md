The given line is $AB$ and the point being $C$. We first construct an equilateral triangle $\triangle DFE$ where $DF=FE=ED$. Also, we'll have that $DC=CE$.

As the sides of $\triangle DFC, \triangle CEF$ are the same, they must also be equivalent (proposition 1.8). This means $\angle DCF = \angle ECF$. By defintion, $CF$ must be perpendicular to $AB$.
