Let

$$
\angle ADE = \angle AED = \theta \\
\angle DAF = \phi_1 \\
\angle FAE = \phi_2
$$

And we also take that $\angle DAE = \phi = \phi_1 + \phi_2$. The construction have that $\triangle DEF$ be an equilateral triangle (proposition 1.1) and $\triangle ADE$ is an isoceles triangle (you can take some points along the line $AB$ and $AC$ and use proposition 1.3 to make the them of equal length).

The main idea is to have the same exact copy of two triangles that shares angles but differ only at one. Then, if we make sure the rest of the length matches, we can show the differing angles to be the same.

From the construction, we can see that our target triangles are $\triangle ADF$ and $\triangle AEF$. They both share a side $AF$ with $DF = EF$ and that $AD = AE$. Since both of these triangles have matching sides, by proposition 1.8, $\phi_1=\phi_2=\theta /2 $.
