# Proposition

> If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has the angle encompassed by the equal straight-lines greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the other), then (the former triangle) will also have a base greater than the base (of the latter).

Say that $CAB > FDE$. Then, $CB > FE$ given $DE = AB$ and $DF = AC$.

Since $FDE < CAB$, we'll pull a line DG such that $GDE = CAB$. We also pull this line long enough so that $DG = DF$. Since $GDE = CAB$ and that $GD = DF = AC, ED = AB$, $GE = CB$.

Since $DG = DF$, $DGF = DFG$. Now, $EGF < DGF$ since it's the leftover from $ACB$ i.e. $EGF = DGF - ACB$. But, this would also mean that $EFG = DFG = DGF > EGF$. By these angles we can deduce that $GE = CB > EF$ because in a triangle and larger side will subtend the larger angle.
