# Method

We can do it as such:

The 2 circles in the graph is of equal radius. We first start with one circle. Then, we draw the centre of the next circle, say, $B$, at radius length from the center of the first circle, say, $A$. Both circles have the same radius.

Since both circles have the same radius, the center of the circle will lay down at the tangential point of the circle as the figure. Then, it should be straightforward to see that $AC=BC=AB$. The radius of the circle determines the length of the triangle.
