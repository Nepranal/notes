# Proposition

> For any triangle, (the sum of) two angles taken together in any (possible way) is less than two right-angles.

# Proof

You can kinda see this as a consequence of proposition 1.16. We know that if we have a triangle with angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, then we can say

$$
\pi - \gamma > \alpha\\
\pi - \gamma > \beta\\
\pi - \alpha > \beta
$$

You can simply add the subtracted part to each equation and then you can show it
