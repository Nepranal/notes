Say $AC > AB$. Since this is so, we can grab a point D such that $AD = AB$ which would lead to $\angle ADB = ABD$ by proposition 1.5

What we now know is that by proposition 16, $\angle ADB > \angle ACB$ by since it's the external of $\angle BDC$. But, since it's equal to $\angle ABD$, $\angle ABD > \angle ACB$. You can do this for each side of the triangle.
