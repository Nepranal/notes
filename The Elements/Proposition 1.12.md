# Proposition

> To draw a straight-line perpendicular to a given infinite straight-line from a given point which is not on it

This is like the opposite of proposition 1.11

# Method

It's also quite similar to 1.11 but this time we need to find a way to draw our triangles:

The construction has $CG=CE$. We then draw a line $CH$ such that it bisects the angle at $C$ (proposition 1.9). Now, since we have 2 triangles $\triangle GCH, \triangle CEH$ and $CG=CE$, with $\angle GCH = \angle ECH$, by proposition 1.4, the two triangles must be equivalent. This results to $\angle CHG = \angle CHE$.

> The only difference between my argument and the one in the book is that the book says $H$ is the midpoint between $GE$ which should be fine (hopefully)
