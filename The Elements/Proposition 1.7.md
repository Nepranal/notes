# Proposition

> On the same straight-line, two other straight-lines equal, respectively, to two (given) straight-lines (which meet) cannot be constructed (meeting) at a different point on the same side (of the straight-line), but having the same ends as the given straight-lines.

Given a straight line $AB$, and 2 pairs of straight line $AC, BC$ and $AD, BD$ for which the ones that has the same starting point has the same length, it is impossible for them to be be drawn on the same side of $AB$ and have the two meeting points of the pair be different.

# Proof

2 Triangles to look at: $\triangle ACD, \triangle BCD$

Since $AC = AD$, we know that $\angle ACD = \angle ADC = \theta$

From here, we'd know that $\angle BCD = \angle BDC = \gamma$.

Say that $\gamma > \theta$. You'll find that the angles would be contradictory at point C since $\gamma < \theta$ because $A$ is at a distance away from $B$. Similar argument can made for $\gamma < \theta$ but now the problematic point would be at $D$. Hence, contradiction

# Personal Remarks

I find it kind of weird that such a structure is inherently impossible yet here it is being drawn. To sort of see why, it must be that some of the conditions are not satisfied, say, the equal length part.
