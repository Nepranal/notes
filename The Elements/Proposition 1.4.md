# Proposition

> If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, re-spectively, and have the angle(s) enclosed by the equal straight-lines equal, then they will also have the base equal to the base, and the triangle will be equal to the tri-angle, and the remaining angles subtended by the equal sides will be equal to the corresponding remaining an-gles.

If two triangles have the same 2 sides of same length and that these two sides are enclosing the same angle, then the triangles are equal.

Say that $AB=DE, AC=DF$ and both are enclosing angle $\theta$. First, lets how $BC = EF$. The main idea is we can super impose the parts that are the same. In this case, we'll put $A \rightarrow D, B \rightarrow E, C \rightarrow F$. They must overlap perfectly by the premise of this proposition. Now, if we pull a straight line from $B$ to $C$, we must have also pulled the same line from $E$ to $F$. For if we do not, then there must be an area created by two straight line with the same starting and ending point. This is not possible.

Since all of the sides are the same, the angles subtended by any two sides must also be the same since now the two triangles overlaps one another perfectly.
