# Proposition

> For two given unequal straight-lines, to cut off from the greater a straight-line equal to the lesser.

Basically, from two line of unequal length, cut the longer line so its length is equal to the shorter length

# Method

Turns our, quite simple actually. Just draw a circle from one of the ends of the longer line with a radius equal to the shorter length. The lines outside of the circle can be discarded

In this case, $C$ is the shorter length, and $AB$ is the line to cut. $EB$ can be discarded from $AB$ and that $AE = C$.
