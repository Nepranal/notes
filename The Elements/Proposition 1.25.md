# Proposition

> If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, respectively, but (one) has a base greater than the base (of the other), then (the former triangle) will also have the angle encompassed by the equal straight-lines greater than the (corresponding) angle (in the latter).

This is the opposite of proposition 1.24.

Say we have two triangles $\triangle ABC, \triangle DEF$ and that $AB = DE, AC = DF$ and that $BC > DF$.

Assume $BAC \leq EDF$. Well, $BAC \neq EDF$ since if that was the case, $BC = EF$. $BAC$ cannot be less then either since that would mean $BC < EF$. Hence, $BAC > EDF$.
