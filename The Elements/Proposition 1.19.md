# Proposition

> In any triangle, the greater angle is subtended by the greater side.

This is to make an iff with proposition 1.18.

# Proof

![alt text](<../sources/The Elements/Screenshot 2025-12-24 at 2.24.24 AM.png>)

Say $\angle ABC > \angle ACB$. Show that $AC > AB$.

First of all, $AC \neq AB$ since if so, $\angle ABC = \angle ACB$. Neither can $AC < AB$ because then $\angle ABC < \angle ACB$ by proposition 1.18. Hence, $AC > AB$.

# Alternative

Assume $AC < AB$. By proposition 1.18, this would mean $\angle ACB > \angle ABC$ which is a contradiction.
