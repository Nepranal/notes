# Proposition

> To cut a given finite straight-line in half.

# Method

The idea is to construct an equilateral triangle with that line as the base. Then draw a line that splits the angle opposite of the base into half.

You'll then end up with 2 triangles that shares 2 sides (the drawn line and the fact it's equilateral), and an angle. By proposition 1.4, this base must then be of the same length.
