# Proposition

> If two triangles have two sides equal to two sides, re-spectively, and also have the base equal to the base, then they will also have equal the angles encompassed by the equal straight-lines.

If two triangles have their sides matching, then so will the angles

# Proof

Let's impose $\triangle ABC$ with $\triangle DEF$. Assume that there exist some angles which are not the same as the angles from $\triangle DEF$. Then, you can always draw $\triangle EGF$ where $EG = ED$ since $AB = DE$ and follows the other side except $EF$. This is a contradiction by proposition 1.7 $\square$.
