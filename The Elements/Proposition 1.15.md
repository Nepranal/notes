Say $\angle AED = \theta$ and $\angle AEC = \phi$. We have to show that $\angle CEB = \theta, \angle DEB = \phi$.

By proposition 1.13, we can say that $\phi = \pi - \theta$. Since $\angle DEB$ is also adjacent to $\theta$, then $\angle DEB = \pi - \theta = \theta$. You can do this one more time to show that $\angle CEB = \theta$.
