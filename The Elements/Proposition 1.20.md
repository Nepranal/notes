# Proposition

> In any triangle, (the sum of) two sides taken together in any (possible way) is greater than the remaining (side).

# Proof

Our triangle is $\triangle ABC$. First, let's extend line $AB$ to $D$ such that $AD = AC$. This way $\angle ADC = \angle ACD$.

Now, what must be true is that $\angle BCD > \angle ACD = \angle BDC$. By proposition 1.19, it must be that $BD = BA + AD > BC$. You can take similar approach to show the other sides (just switch the target from $BC$).

# Alternative Construction

Another way is to purely rely on right angles. Notice that by propositions 1.16, if it's a right triangle, then the hypothenus must be bigger than either side. You can then draw these 2 cases:
