Say $\angle BAC = \alpha, \angle ABC = \beta, \angle BCA = \gamma$. Then, we have to show that $\angle ACD = \pi - \gamma$ is bigger than $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

To construct the geometry, we first split $AC$ into 2 lines $AE, EC$ of equal length (proposition 1.10). Then we pull a line from $B$ and create $BE$. Then, we pull a line in the same direction as $BE$ such that it's of equal length to it (proposition 1.3). Finally, pull a line from $C$ to $F$.

What you'll find is that $\triangle ABE = \triangle EFC$. Since $AE = EC$ and $EF = BE$ with, from proposition 1.15, $\angle AEB = \angle FEC$, by proposition 1.4, those two triangles must be the same.

Since they are the same, $\angle ECF = \alpha$. And since $\angle ECF < \angle ECD$, $\alpha < \pi - \gamma$. You can take a similar approach to show this fact for $\beta$.

Though in order to move $\pi - \gamma$ and $\beta$ around like that requires one more thing
